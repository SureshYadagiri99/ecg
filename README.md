Emoji Catcher Game Emoji Catcher is a fun and engaging browser-based game where players catch falling emojis by clicking on the correct square within a time limit. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out. Each time an emoji appears in a square, the player needs to click on that square to score points. The game ends when the timer reaches zero, displaying the player's final score.

Features: Timer Countdown: The game starts with 60 seconds on the clock. Players must act quickly to catch the emojis before time runs out. Random Emoji Placement: Emojis appear randomly in different squares on the grid, adding an element of unpredictability and challenge. Score Tracking: Players’ scores are updated in real-time as they catch emojis, showing the total points they’ve accumulated. Responsive Layout: The game is designed to be played on various screen sizes, adapting to desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used: HTML: The basic structure and layout of the game, including the score and timer displays, as well as the grid of squares. CSS: Styling for the game interface, including the grid and emoji styling. The design is minimalistic with dark-themed backgrounds to make the emoji pop. JavaScript: The game logic, including handling random emoji placement, player interaction (clicking on squares), timer countdown, and score tracking.

How to Play: Click on the emoji that appears in the grid of squares to score points. A new emoji will appear at random intervals in different squares. The game lasts for 60 seconds. Try to score as many points as possible before time runs out! Once the timer reaches zero, your final score will be displayed.

Installation: Clone or download the repository. Open index.html in any modern browser to start playing the game.

Future Enhancements: Add different levels of difficulty with faster emoji spawn rates. Implement sounds for game interactions (e.g., score sounds, game over sounds). Enhance styling with animations (e.g., emoji bounce or fade-in effects). Implement a leaderboard system to track high scores.
